# FindMaxSum
The task of finding a list row with the maximum sum of elements.  
A file is provided (the path to the file must either be requested 
from the user at program startup, or taken from command line parameters if specified).  
Each line contains a set of numbers (comma, decimal point).  
Output the line number with the maximum sum of elements.  
Display the line numbers that contain non-numeric elements ("missing lines") as a separate list.
